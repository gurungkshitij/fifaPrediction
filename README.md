# [Salary, Value, and Overall Rating prediction: Football (Soccer)](https://github.com/gurungkshitij/fifaPrediction/blob/master/Kshitij-Johe-Fifa.pdf)


This is a very intersting project specially for those football fans who are curious to know what could possibly determine the salary, market value, and overall fifa rating of football players. In this project, we attempted to implememted powerful machine learning algorithms on fifa 18 data set and tried to come up with accurate predictions for salary, market value, and overall rating prediction.

The project is broken into two main sections. 
1) Salary, Market Value Prediction ( Numerical and catagorical). 
Using fifa18 dataset, we train, test, and crossvalidate following algorithms and compared the results. 
• Penalized Lasso regression
• Penalized Ridge regression
• Forward selection
• Backward selection
• KNN regression
• Decision Trees
• Bagging
• RandomForest
• Boosting

2) Overall Rating prediction.
we are interested in seeing how well the performances of a player in real-lifepredicts their “Overall” fifa rating. Naturally, if a player is considered good, their overall might be high, butthe public’s conceptions of what makes a “good” player is very subjective, and FIFA is forced to meet the challenge of quantifying it. We want to see how well we can predict a future FIFA overall rating based on a set of real life performance statistics.
