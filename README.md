# [Salary, Value, and Overall Rating prediction: Football (Soccer)](https://github.com/gurungkshitij/fifaPrediction/blob/master/FinalReport-Fifa.pdf)


This is a very intersting project, specially for the football fans, who are curious to know what could possibly determine the salary, market value, and overall fifa rating of football players. In this project, we tried to implememted various machine learning algorithms on fifa 18 data set and aimed to achieve accurate predictions for salary, market value, and overall rating prediction. We also attemped to investigate how well the performances of a player in real-life predicts their “Overall” fifa rating. Naturally, if a player is considered good, their overall might be high, butthe public’s conceptions of what makes a “good” player is very subjective, and FIFA is forced to meet the challenge of quantifying it. We wanted to see how well we could predict a future FIFA overall rating based on a set of real life performance statistics.

The project is broken into two main sections. 

1) **Salary, Market Value Prediction** ( Numerical and catagorical). We also catagorized the salary and value to high, medium, and low and performed classification predictions. We implemeted following algorithms and compared the results. 

• Penalized Lasso regression

• Penalized Ridge regression

• Forward selection

• Backward selection

• KNN regression

• Decision Trees

• Bagging

• RandomForest

• Boosting

2) **Overall Rating prediction.** We wanted to see how well we could predict a future FIFA overall rating based on a set of real life performance statistics.

• PCA

• Cluestering

• Penalized Ridge regression

• RandomForest

• Boosting

### How users can get started with the project?

- FiFaPred.Rmd is the main file 
- After you download all the files, change the directories of the datasets as you read in the csv files in FifaPred.Rmd 
- Everythign should run smoothly. Knit the file if you want the pdf/html version
